class Stack:
    """
    A Stack to represent a stack of glasses.

    The data structure used is a flattened binary tree since it is always perfectly balanced.
    Hence can get the left and right child by the a simple formula: 2 * depth + 1 and 2 * depth + 2.

    Time complexity is O(n) for pouring water and O(1) for looking up glass.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_levels : int
        The initial number of levels that the stack has.


    Attributes
    ----------
    n_levels : int
        The number of levels that the stack has.
    glasses: Glass[]
        A list contains the glasses of the stack.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> from plexus import Stack
    >>> stack = Stack(n_levels=2)
    >>> stack.pour(2000)
    [Glass(current_capacity=250), Glass(current_capacity=250), Glass(current_capacity=250)]
    >>> print(stack.get_glass(0, 0))
    250
    >>> print(stack.get_glass(1, 0))
    250
