## Crtieria

#### Clean code. It should be readable, production quality code. ✅

#### Code that follows good design principles and shows that the engineer has an understanding for architecturing clean, simple and extensible systems. ✅

SOLID was somewhat used.

#### Good object modeling. We are looking for object-oriented solution, even if you think procedural code would make more sense for this problem. ✅

Despite this being a small problem, I've tried my best to mimic it in the most OOP way as I can.

#### Evidence of TDD - hint we want to see a lot of tests. Tests that have been used to drive out the design. ✅

The architectural design was driven by TDD.

#### Any assumptions and /or constraints should be documented ✅

The user can pour more water after and add more levels to the stack.

#### Submission should have clear instructions on how to run it ✅

This is just like a Python library. Example is in `example.py` file.

#### An appropriate build tool should be selected for generation of any executable artifacts and setting up any library dependencies ✅

Out of the box, no dependencies needed.

#### Bonus points if the submission executes and solves the described problem. ✅
